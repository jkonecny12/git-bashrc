git-bashrc
==========

My bashrc in Fedora 20 (it's using return code and git in PS1)

#GIT part
It could help people which using git often.

- show actual chosen branch of current folder
- if something is add for commit or some file in repo is changed -> name of the branch will be yellow
- if not -> name of the branch will be red

#Return code part
Return code is showed when the last command return value isn't zero.
